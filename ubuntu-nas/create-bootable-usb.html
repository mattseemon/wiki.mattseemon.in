<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>, a free and open source USB drive writing tool (Portable Edition preferred)</li>
  <li>Ubuntu Server ISO file. Download links available <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">here.</a></li>
  <li>4 GB or larger USB drive</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin with, plug in the USB Drive you are going to run the Ubuntu Server installer from into a PC.</p>
<p>This guide assumes you are using a windows PC to get the bootable USB drive created. You can find plenty of tutorials on the internet for how to do the same on MacOS and Linux.</p>
<p>Next double click the downloaded file for Rufus to start the program. If you downloaded the installer, you will need to install the application first.</p>
